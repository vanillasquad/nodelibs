# nodelibs

nodelibs is an app which is used to fill in madlibs templates. The user will be
asked to input the first 3 letters of a noun, adjective, verb, etc. The app will
then randomly get a word starting with the input to build the madlib text. After
all the sections are filled in, the completed madlib will be shown on the screen.
